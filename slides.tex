    \emph{easy}; if you've got a small script and no external
    dependencies, it doesn't really matter what you do -- it's
    probably going to be reproducible.  On the other hand, if you're
    working with GB of data from various sources, using a cluster for
    computing, dealing with sensitive data, working with closed source
    or difficult to compile software, reproducibility is going to be
    hard.

      punctuation in the text is silly.  Getting the caching right is

      grab a copy of a paper with this in.  Examples include Ben
      Bolker's paper, my paper, the one Neil on twitter
    \item Things to target knitr: sowsear and knitr's \code{spin}
    \item The \emph{principle} carries over to non-knitr work though:
      the figures should always be regeneratable from the code.  You
      don't need fancy formatting for that to happen though, just a

      less popular among scientists at the moment.  Gitorius and

    Getting into extra-for-experts territory here

    Basic workflow:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Make changes
    \item Check things look OK locally
    \item Push to github
    \item Travis spins up (show a few snippets from the logs)

    The good:

    I think that this is the future.  If we'd been using this from the
    beginning, we'd have noticed lots of problems that affected us
    later.

    Because you find out as soon as things break, you only have to
    look at a small set of changes.  If you're regularly breaking one
    thing you know where you need to put your time.

    You can collect the output from each run and store them somewhere
    - can turn this into a virtual lab notebook!

    The bad:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item not a perfect fit to research
    \item open source public projects only
    \item not going to work with sensitive data
    \item not going to work with long running jobs
