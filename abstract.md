Reproducible Research using R (and other tools)

Reproducibility in research is increasingly called for, but carrying
it out remains a challenge.  I will give a tour through the tools used
in a recent real-life research project where we attempted to make the
project reproducible from data acquisition to generating the
manuscript.  These tools include the R packages "knitr" (for
generating reports directly from R output) and "packrat" (for
dependency management), as well as tools outside of R: make for
pipeline management, git for version control, and travis for
continuous testing of the research.  Our experience shows both the
potential benefits of reproducible research, but also the challenges
remaining in implementing it.

Macquarie University.  His research interests are about reconstructing
trait evolution and diversification over millions of years.  He has
been using R in a research context for 10 years, and is the author of
a number of packages for evolutionary analysis.  He also teaches R
skills through Software Carpentry.
